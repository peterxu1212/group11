%{\small
%Appeasement has been overstated as a cause of World War II. Popular disposition and economic factors exerted much greater influence over the flow of events during the inter-war period. %Facts drawn from Keith Eubank's analysis: \emph{The Origins of World War II} reinforce this standpoint even as Eubank argues that appeasement was a primary causal factor. }\\
