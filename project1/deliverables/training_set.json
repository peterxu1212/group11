[black](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black_people) itself has different connotations all across the world so you will get different responses when you are calling someone from brazil a black person compared to someone from canada or the united states. you'll notice that pretty much everyone who considers themselves to be black will also acknowledge that they have a lot of african ancestry down the line, though. (there's the fact that africa is also an incredibly huge continent and there are also white africans so one would be under the assumption that if a white person from africa comes to the usa that their race would be \"african american,\" but the reality is that they will still be called a white american. it's all based on looks.. it's an incredibly huge socially constructed value here in the usa).      \n\nabout african american... well, you can't tell whether someone is african american or not just by looking at them. some people might be from nigeria (an african country), so they might call themselves a nigerian-american after they get their citizenship. there are over 50 countries in africa &amp; i'm sure you can imagine the confusion this can cause. people form other countries simply **will not** get it because race is a social construct and yet it still means *so much*. \n\nthis is why \"black\" is kind of a word that we can all agree on here in the us. no matter if we are jamaican, somalian, canadian, american, brazilian, whatever... we can kind of agree with it. \n\nyou can add \"racial mixing\" to the mix and acknowledge that not all people who are dark skinned are completely black, yet they are still forced to identify as [only] black. for example, my nephew is half puerto rican (they are racially mixed with spanish/taino/african) and half black, so no matter what he identifies more with, he will always be [just] \"black.\" this makes a lot of people mad, specifically people who may be mixed with 50/50 or even with 3 different backgrounds because society will only see one part of them. this can be sad for a person who is mixed with 'black' or not.          \n\nalso, the term \"negro\" itself isn't offensive. it literally means black in spanish/portuguese and comes from the latin word 'niger' which also means black. believe it or not but at one point in time, \"negro\" was the politically correct word of choice. during the civil rights movement there was a divide in black people about what our identity was because, well, it was wiped away from them. some people wanted to get completely away from anything associated with the white people in america, so they decided to make up new terms. the white peoples' names for them went like this: n****r -&gt; colored -&gt; negro -&gt; and then there was a divide where the black people themselves were divided in whether or not to choose from any of the following: afro-american, black american, and negro. \n\nsome people still wanted to identify with the continent of africa but understandably some grew up knowing *nothing* about where they were from &amp; with the white people treating you more harshly the more black/african you identified with, they wanted to stay away from it. \n\nso basically you got people of all ages with different economical backgrounds (some were mixed with white or were generally mixed-looking or flat out white-passing) and different political views (think: the more violent malcom x versus martin luther king jr.) trying to come up with the same end pov. it hasn't happened and still hasn't happened. nowadays youth will use the words interchangeably-- well, except for \"negro\" and \"afro-american\" because those just sound weird, haha! but you'll get the oldest black people still identifying with those outdated words. with that said there are still organizations, businesses, and college funds that used the term negro in them so the word 'negro' is completely okay when used for historical purposes. when you see young black people calling other black people negros, please know that 99% of them are not serious. they will look at you strange if you call them negros in the usa. \n\nwith that said, here's [one of my favorite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8xjxkyl8pu) youtube videos about apologizing if someone says what you've said offends them. you don't really have to agree with everything she says but it's a great way to do damage control. just call black people black and you shouldn't ever have a problem in north america. can't help you with other parts of the continent or other continents because 'race' means completely different things there but just be confident in your speaking and apologize even if you're thinking 'wtf? how the f#ck could that offend you?' and try not to twitch and you'll be fine, lol. :) even i've had to do it &amp; re-educate myself. \n\nokay, wow. so i am all over the world with my comment but i hope that i at least enlightened you a little bit. i am sorry if something i say is more confusing than it helps. i do hope that you won't be apprehensive about approaching us anymore, though. the more you acknowledge our differences and are okay with them, the cooler we will think you are. :)", "is_root": false, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.4784100173851937}, {"text": "the way she lights up when she talks about her passions, nothing can match the way she smiles and her eyes widen when she tells me about what she loves, i think its beautiful.", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.7988787859798024}, {"text": "[deleted]", "is_root": false, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.4207469947329765}, {"text": "/u/gallowboob?\n\n**edit**: misread the question. op asked for popular, not least popular redditor. i formally retract my statement.

i helped with way more than he did.\" the reply he gave me was so condescending, all he said was \"you're a drug dealer, i can't have you part of it\". the guy i was fronting to all of a sudden had no money to pay me for the front and his excuse was \"people are being really jewish not spending money around christmas\". this was literally what he said right before i asked about why i didn't sign any papers.\n\ni was so disgusted by the lies and manipulation i just got up and left saying \"after all i did for you, go fuck yourselves\".\n\na year later i hear around school he's telling people \"i went crazy and threatened to kill him and his entire family\". i literally have not said a word to him since i left his apartment about 9 months before. i had to actually go to his brother (who i was still selling weed to and had no idea me and his brother weren't talking anymore) and tell him to cut it out or i would be forced to sue him for defamation.\n\nthe friend who was selling my fronted weed still has not paid me, they also claim they told me before but when i asked when they cite a time where we all collectively smoked 7 grams so we could go eat so much we pass out, also i fronted the one friend an ounce before this. it was supposedly talked about during the meal. they said the reason i don't remember is because i had a seizure from some mushrooms they had bought. when i saw them later they were as black as night and moldy. it was one of the most disgusting excuses i had ever heard.\n\nif they had been upfront about it from the beginning i wouldn't have a problem but they used me and said nothing just to fuck me over in the end. they wanted me to stop selling completely at a time when there was no revenue coming in. basically telling me to throw away $30k+ a year for nothing. i would have no problem not selling anymore if there was a form of revenue for me to pay my bills and rent, but this was not the case and they knew full well that's how i paid my bills. my plan was to stop once there was money coming in but they wanted to make the decision for me like they were morally superior and leave me to struggle with no income.\n\nthe kicker is once all this happened they tried to get a documentary funded about medical marijuana for use on ptsd, asking for literally half a million for the entire project. it failed spectacularly but the level of hypocrisy can't be made up. i just also want to add the reason you form an llc is to separate personal assets from the companies so even if something happened to me it wouldn't affect the company. whenever i tell this story to my banker friend he just gets mad at how dumb of an excuse they used.\n\ntldr friends fucked me out of a company i helped with more than anyone over me selling weed even though they knew before any talk of the company and the whole time they said i would be a part of it then they made disgusting excuses for themselves and spread completely false rumors about me after the fact.", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.39729354510739606}, {"text": "for me, the motive for a lifelong campaign of destroying everything that bitch ever loved.", "is_root": false, "controversiality": 0, "children": 0, "popularity_score": 0.9643509287436869}, {"text": "i agree. on a certain level, i think everyone practices eugenics. when we look at potential mates, we don't choose ones with obvious deficits or disorders.  we ask our partners about their genetic history (do you have huntington\u2019s, pd, ad, downs syndrome etc.?), and we have sperm banks where you can hand pick your donor (ie wanting one with a high iq and good at sports, for example). \n\nadvent of crispr technology is going to open the doors for designer babies in the future, as soon as the moratorium is lifted off of working with human embryos. then the real eugenics will begin.
