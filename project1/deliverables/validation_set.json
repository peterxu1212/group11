environment is a thousand times better.  my hs sociology teacher (a really down to earth guy who doesn't buy into all of the college hype) told us we should at least consider it because the flexibility of setting your own schedule and the general pace and feel of things makes a huge difference compared to high school.\n\nmy biggest complaint with high school (as i said in my original comment) is that teachers have zero respect for your time.  i'm on winter break at the moment and have a huge-ass book to read.  college kids are off for two more weeks and have no responsibilities because their classes have ended.  even when i get a break, it's really not a break.  it's just less work.\n\nthe saddest part is that i can't figure out why some teachers do this sort of thing.  they aren't bad people.  they actually think it's helping.  they know the stress it puts us under.  they know we only do it for the grades.  they know whatever packet they make us do or book they make us read will ultimately have no impact on our education.  it's incredibly frustrating when you have these excellent and incredibly nice people beat you over the head with so much work it brings you to tears.\n\ni fear it's only going to get worse for high school students.  duel enrollment will be the next \"ap class\" for people wanting to go to college.  it used to be that ap classes were only for the best of the best.  now, any schmuck whose parents want their baby to go to an ivy league can get put into one as long as the parents sign off.  my ap classes are absolutely massive now and are just as overcrowded as the rest of the school.  \n\nhowever, a very small pocket of those ap kids are being shipped off on a school bus a few times a week to a local university for duel enrollment courses.  once the rest of the country catches on, it's over.  the kids going to college will be all caught up in that business.  as you said, it's already an uphill battle to get into a mid-tier school.  guess what?  it's only getting higher from here.\n\ni don't even blame the colleges for this mess.  it's a societal problem.  at some point in the past 25-30 years america decided everyone needed to go to college.  because our system is broken at its core, this is the result.  rather than college being a place for higher education where people who loved learning and did well in school could attend, it's now where society expects you to go.  colleges are being forced to be more selective than ever every single day.\n\ni'm ranting at this point.  i just hope everyone on all sides

decided to use both of us. i was wearing a certain shirt one day and she asked where i got it. the next day she was wearing the same shirt. i got my hair cut short. a week later she has the same hair cut. she even said things like \"so that we can be twins!\" etc. then things got weird. she'd show up to rehearsals early and learn my songs, and tell the band director i told her she could play them.  she started telling everyone a ton of lies about me and my family that got more and more serious (like, telling people that my dad was abusive and would beat my brother and i if we played a wrong note). she sabotaged every performance i did. nobody would talk to me anymore, and i would end up being alone on one side of the dressing room because nobody even wanted to sit next to me. i would cry every time i just walked into the building. i didn't want to quit and let her win, but eventually i had to for my sanity. congratulations rachel, you bitch. i hope being the *only fiddle player in some shitty local band* was all you'd ever hoped it would be and more.\n\nthe same thing happened in college, essentially (though my friend wasn't a bitch like that first girl). she had no musical talent whatsoever, but since i did music she would always try to sing over me and whatnot. she joined my music fraternity. she started wearing my clothes. she moved into my apartment. she tried to become better friends with my friends (who were all dudes, so that she could be their \"best girl friend\" or whatever). she started dating my boyfriend's best friend.  she started working at the same place i did. and *one* day i expressed an interest in something that she was good at and she flipped out and yelled at me in front of all her friends, saying that it was *her* thing, not mine. okay.
