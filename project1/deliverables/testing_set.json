kayleeanne. not kaylee. not kay. kayleeanne. \n\neverything she did from the beginning of this ordeal had to be engineered (whether consciously or not) to ruin my cousin's day. \n\nshe \"lost\" three hundred dollars worth of booze before the engagement party. she got drunk at the lingerie party and tried on some of my cousin's really expensive brand new lingerie. like i almost considered taking her to small claims court because i found the four pairs of la perla panties i bought my cousin on the bathroom floor after kaylee fucking anne had trashed them... with a bunch of other stuff. there was a handmade corset in the tub too. i can't remember who gave my cousin that but it was custom. she brought coke to the bachelorette party (hey, i'm not fucking complaining) but she was really fucking obnoxious about it. she kept telling people we had it, oh my god i thought we were going to get arrested. there are so many things she did at the showers/fittings/brunches/parties we had. \n\nthe night before the wedding she got really really drunk and told me and the moh she loved her brother and felt like she was losing her family... take that as you will. the next day was a comedy of errors. kayleeanne woke up really hung over and i gave her a bloody mary and told her to get her ass in gear... i was just not in the mood to deal with her whining and i hadn't seen my own husband in like 48hours and i kind of need him to center me sometimes. so i thought whatever hair of the dog, she'll be ok. no. she got drunk. like puking drunk. i found out later she had drank way more vodka than that weak bloody mary i made her after i left our room (yeah, i volunteered to room with her) to meet the dudes with the tables downstairs. kayleeanne had a \"coughing fit\" during the ceremony. she also \"tripped\" twice while walking down the aisle. later the groomsman told me she totally pulled away from him and fell on purpose. \n\nit was a total mess. she really doesn't like me either. i started calling her ka immediately after meeting her and i told her she looked like she smoked. according to my cousin, ka still calls me \"that fat alcoholic cunt\". i am not fat or an alcoholic. the last time i saw her, i pretended to forget her name. i called her kelseyanne. \n\nanyways, thankfully my sweet, awesome cousin did not let ka bother her and she had a good time on her special day. that's all that really matters.  \n", "is_root": true, "controversiality": 0, "children": 1, "popularity_score": 3.5420983017442116}, {"text": "the force awakens. if i didn't see it at least twice i'd

yeah. no. that chameleon will eventually need an open-air (screen) cage at least 24x24x48\". it will need live plants and temperature control. it needs basking lights and a uvb tube. it needs at least 3 different feeder bugs and 2 different types of\ncalcium supplement. it needs humidity and temp drop at night too. \n\nthose baby tortoises are going to need an entire yard of space, and no you cannot just feed them lettuce and broccoli their whole lives. they may live over 30 yrs. they need proper heat during the winter so they dont freeze (or they might hibernate depending on the species).\n\nthose betta fish cant stay in a tiny vase. they need space like any other animal.\n\nthose frogs arent disposable. you need to feed them bugs and plant their enclosures, give them hiding space and humidity and uvb. \n\nthose leo geckos sure are cute but theyve probably gulped down some fucking sand from petcos cages and will be impacted in their gut. dont fucking put sand in any reptiles cage unless its a sandfish. the geckos need calcium, uvb, heat, hiding space, humid and dry spots...\n\nbearded dragon you saw? no, it cant live with another. it shouldnt. there is always a chance one of them could bite the other, no matter how much they \"like\" each other. they can bully each other for food and bite each others toes off. they need at least a 50gal cage as an adult and a 90+ degree heat lamp. they need darkness at night and a uvb at day. they need calcium and crickets and dubia roaches and a variety of bugs. they need baths unless you want them to stink like fuck. and for fucks sake no you cant keep it on sand or \"ground up seeds\". or calci sand. calci sand is the worst for impaction. \n\nand for gods fucking sake, just bc you keep a reptile in small cage does not mean it will stay small.\n\npetco and petsmart specifically are just fucking terrible. but even mom and pop stores are bad.\n\none of the stores i went to the other day had a beardie adult in a 10g cage and only moss. it was also seemingly choking on the moss.\n\nanother store i used to go to had a chameleons lights off during the day because it \"wasnt dark yet\". ummm....
